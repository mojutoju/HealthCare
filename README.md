# Using-Data-Analysis-to-Predict-Hospital-Readmissions
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis conducted to predict hospital readmissions using healthcare data. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and feature importance analysis. Below is a structured summary, including methodologies, results, and recommendations.

# To predict hospital readmissions using patient data, with the goal of identifying factors that contribute to readmissions and providing actionable insights for reducing them.

**1. Data Sources:**
Primary Dataset: **diabetic_data.csv** containing patient information.
Supplementary Dataset: **IDS_mapping.csv,** though not directly used in modeling.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Steps:
Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing data, which was minimal and did not significantly impact the analysis.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Label encoding was applied to convert categorical features into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

**Code Snippet:**
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
# Encoding categorical variables
label_encoders = {}
for col in categorical_columns:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    diabetic_data[col] = le.fit_transform(diabetic_data[col].astype(str))
    label_encoders[col] = le

# Scaling numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
diabetic_data[numerical_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(diabetic_data[numerical_columns])

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Key Insights:**
Distribution of Time in Hospital: Most hospital stays were short, typically less than 10 days.
Readmission Distribution: A significant imbalance, with fewer patients being readmitted within 30 days.
Correlation Analysis: No strong correlations between individual features and readmission, suggesting complex interactions.

5. Feature Importance Analysis
Key Findings:
The top features impacting readmissions were identified using Random Forestâ€™s feature_importances_.
Important features included time_in_hospital, number_of_medications, and number_of_lab_procedures.

**6. Recommendations and Next Steps**

**Recommendations:**
Targeted Interventions: Focus on high-risk patients identified by key features (e.g., longer hospital stays).
Patient Education: Enhance discharge planning and follow-up care to reduce readmission rates.
Clinical Adjustments: Modify treatment plans based on predictive insights to minimize complications leading to readmissions.

**Next Steps:**
Model Tuning: Further optimize models with hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
Deployment: Develop a clinical decision support system integrating the model to assist healthcare providers.
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly update models with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.

**Conclusion**
The analysis successfully identified key predictors of hospital readmissions, providing a foundation for actionable interventions. Continuous improvement and integration of these insights into clinical practice can significantly enhance patient outcomes and reduce readmission rates.
